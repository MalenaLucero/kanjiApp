Hello. I'm making this web application to make connections between the Japanese kanji I study everyday and I thought it might help other people. I've just started, so there's a long way to go.

If you want to see how it works, start by adding kanji through the "New kanji" input. Add, for example, 新しい, then 聞く and then 新聞. When you add the last one, the app will show you the first two because they share the same kanji. The "search" button does the same and it tells you if the word you're searching has been added before or not.

Soon I'll add a functionality related to the JLPT level of the kanjis stored.
