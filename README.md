This is a web application to make connections between the kanji of different Japanese words. When you input a word, the app will tell you if you've added a word with those kanji before or not. It also creates a list of kanji and divides them by grade and JLPT level. I've added some words from Evangelion's opening theme so people who don't know Japanese can try it out. If you want to add a word and don't know Japanese, copy this one: 残念

The fact that this project uses local storage is a huge handicap, so now I'm trying to figure out how to turn it into an Android app with Java. That might take a while, though.

PRs are welcome :)
